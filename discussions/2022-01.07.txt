Continual learning for robots
teach robot to do sth, then teach something else -> should do both
scalable to 10-15 tasks in tandem

image 1: red are training data, blue are reproduced data
-> shold be able to learn writing different letters

this work: simulation environment, try out different approaches
* reinforcement learning (not possible w/ real robot)
* kinesthetic teaching: holding robot by hand and "showing" movements
* 3-4 different appraoches in comparaison

examples:
* door opening: different kinds of door handles
* block pushing: blocks with different frictions, surfaces

task 1: research whats out there in terms of simulators
* mb start w/ coppeliaSim
* gazebo simulator
* panda (franka) robot
* will get more links -> prefer open source software

task 2: implement CL algorithms
taks 3: compare performance in simulations

bigger picture: use environment in later work 

will get:
* links for simulators
* papers to read on CL algorithms

meet again in week of 2021-01-17
