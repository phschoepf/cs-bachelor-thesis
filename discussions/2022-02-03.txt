- how to integrate integrate muojoco in coppelia
- focus on door gym for now?!
- zid VM
- presentation -> 1st or 2nd week of new semester
- algos to compare
- EWC
- memory activated synapse
- synapse intelligence
- our approach: **hypernetworks**
 
 
develop environments
RAL paper? -> learning from demonstration
next: also RL
hypernetwork would generate policy network (for RL)

my work: concentrate on hypernetwork for RL similar to https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11997.pdf
change how the hypernetwork works

sayantan will give me sample coppeliasim env
- set up
- get familiar with robots
- RL policy methods
 - TD3
 - SAC
 
look into mujoco licensing -> can we publish with it
get panda robot into door gym

next meeting: prep door envi, demostrate pretrained models
