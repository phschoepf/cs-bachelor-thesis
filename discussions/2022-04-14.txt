critic dimension 1 is expected! this is the "quality" of the action
actor features are transformed again in distributions.py

use only 1 hypernetwork for the 2 target networks
 - more output dimensions
 - 2 heads
 
todo: 
 - integrate output layer to HNBase (instead of a separate place)
 - make a single HN for actor and critic
 - function to split the outputs to actor and critic network weights
