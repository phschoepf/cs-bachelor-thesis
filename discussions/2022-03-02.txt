 # TODO in presentation:
 
 ad CL slide: CL is without access to previous training data, more general: multitask learning
 ad previous work: mention types of CL instead of papers: regularization, replay, multi head,...
 ad doorgym slide: 1 slide with fixed points, 1 with optional ideas to expand
  - mention that only 1 task is learned at a time
  - first task gnostic, then task agnostic -> inference task from renderings (CNN)
