- doors: objective functions!
- clfd: maybe use other (more fundamental) repo


TODO
- eval for task cl as triangular matrix
 -- can compute more metrics with this matrix https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.13166.pdf
 
task inference CNN also has to be learned continually

ppo: keep default dimensions from doorgym
task embedding and regularization coefficient
notebook for demos
