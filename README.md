This repo contains code, notes, and instructions for my bachelor thesis.

## DoorGym

The DoorGym environment (`https://github.com/PSVL/DoorGym/`) is used to provide the training world for the robots. We use MuJoCo for physics simulation and visualization of the scene.

## CL Algorithms
As a baseline, we start evaluating the pre-provided reinforcement learning algorithms in DoorGym: Proximity Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor Critic (SAC).
